# Biography

I have developed background knowledge in both electronic engineering and computer science throughout my undergraduate education. Aside from academic studies, I also enjoy learning from hand on practices. I acquired skills in Android development, web development, and data analysis from work. These experiences allow me to put the knowledge learned from academics into actually solving a real-world problem. Hence, I hope that I can continue to hone my skills through both working and learning.

I believe in the saying "Variety is the spice of life." Throughout my teenage years, I have developed a lot of interests. Among all, I especially love playing Go and swimming. At middle school, I got my lifeguard and swimming coach certificate, also, I entered the Taiwan Go Organization for further training to become a professional. Wish I could make friends with the same interest.
