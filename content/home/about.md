# Biography

I am an undergraduate student at National Taiwna University (NTU). My interests include data analysis and machine learning. Currently, I am now working as a research assistant at the NTU's Speech Processing and Machine Learning Laboratory as well as an intern data analyst at [Junyi Academy](http://english.thealliance.org.tw/junyi-academy.html). 

I believe in the saying "Variety is the spice of life." Throughout my teenage years, I have developed a lot of interests. Among all, I especially love playing Go and swimming. At middle school, I got my lifeguard and swimming coach certificate, also, I entered the Taiwan Go Organization for further training to become a professional. Wish I could make friends with the same interest.
